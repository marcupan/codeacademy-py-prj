## Python Syntax

**File:** `4_1_ds-python-syntax-project.py`

This file covers the basic syntax of Python, including:
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Basic arithmetic operations
- String concatenation with `str()` conversion
- Variable manipulation (incrementing/decrementing)
- Print statements
- Real-world application: Insurance cost calculation formula

## Functions

**File:** `4_2_ds-python-functions-project.py`

This file introduces functions in Python:
- Function definition with parameters
- Return values (including multiple return values)
- Function calls with named parameters
- F-strings for string formatting
- Using built-in functions like `abs()`
- Creating helper functions

## Control Flow

**File:** `4_3_ds-python-controlflow-project.py`

This file covers conditional statements and control flow:
- If-else statements
- Function composition (calling one function from another)
- Decision making based on parameter values
- Building more complex logic for applications

## Lists - Basics

**File:** `4_4_ds-python-lists1-project.py`

This file introduces lists and basic list operations:
- Creating and using lists
- The `zip()` function to combine lists
- Converting iterables to lists using `list()`
- Appending items to lists with `append()`
- List comprehensions for data transformation
- Updating lists with new data

## Lists - Advanced Operations

**File:** `4_5_ds-python-lists2-project.py`

This file covers more advanced list operations:
- List methods like `append()`, `count()`, `sort()`
- Finding list length using `len()`
- List indexing (accessing elements by position)
- List slicing (getting subsets of lists)
- Sorting with the `sorted()` function
- Using lambda functions for custom sorting

## Loops

**File:** `4_6_ds-python-loops-project.py`

This file introduces loops for iterating through data:
- For loops to iterate through lists
- Using `range()` with for loops to iterate through indices
- While loops as an alternative to for loops
- List comprehensions for transforming data
- Combining loops with conditional statements
- String formatting with f-strings, including precision formatting (`.2f`)

## Project Application

**File:** `4_7_frida-kahlo-retrospective-project.py`

This file is a project that applies the concepts learned in previous files:
- Creating and manipulating lists
- Using `zip()` to combine lists
- Appending items to lists
- Finding list length with `len()`
- Using `range()` to generate sequences
- Iterating through lists with for loops
- Printing formatted output

## Key Data Science Concepts

Throughout these files, several key data science concepts are introduced:
- Data manipulation and transformation
- Working with numerical data
- Creating and using data structures
- Iterating through datasets
- Filtering and sorting data
- Calculating statistics (averages, differences)
- Applying formulas to data

These fundamentals provide the building blocks for more advanced data science topics like data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Key Data Science Concepts

Throughout these files, several key data science concepts are introduced:
- Probability distributions and their applications
- Statistical inference and hypothesis testing
- Sampling theory and distribution properties
- Confidence intervals and margin of error
- P-values and statistical significance
- Type I and Type II errors
- Regression modeling and prediction
- Parameter estimation
- Statistical vs. practical significance
- Drawing evidence-based conclusions from data

These statistical concepts are fundamental to data science, providing the theoretical foundation for making inferences, testing hypotheses, and building predictive models. Understanding these concepts is crucial for rigorous data analysis and interpretation.

## Matplotlib Basics

**Directory:** `10_1_matplotlib-proj-i`

This project introduces the fundamentals of Matplotlib:
- Creating figures and subplots
- Plotting line charts with markers
- Customizing plot appearance (colors, labels, titles)
- Setting axis ticks and labels
- Adding legends to plots
- Creating multi-line plots
- Adjusting layout with `tight_layout()`
- Saving figures to image files
- Creating side-by-side plots for comparison
- Visualizing time series data

## Categorical Data Visualization

**Directory:** `10_2_mushroom-categories-project`

This project focuses on visualizing categorical data:
- Creating bar charts and count plots
- Visualizing distributions across categories
- Creating heatmaps for correlation matrices
- Using color palettes for categorical variables
- Creating grouped bar charts
- Visualizing proportions and percentages
- Customizing categorical plots
- Handling and visualizing multi-categorical data
- Drawing insights from categorical visualizations
- Creating effective comparative visualizations

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

**Directory:** `10_3_eda-and-data-visualization`

This advanced project combines EDA with visualization techniques:
- Loading and exploring data with pandas
- Calculating descriptive statistics (mean, median)
- Creating histograms with Seaborn's `histplot`
- Creating scatter plots with regression lines using `lmplot`
- Adding hue for categorical variables in plots
- Creating box plots for distribution comparison
- Customizing plot appearance (jitter, transparency, size)
- Filtering data for visualization
- Sampling data for better visualization
- Comparing distributions across categories
- Visualizing relationships between variables

## Key Data Science Concepts

Throughout these files, several key data visualization concepts are introduced:
- Choosing the right visualization for different data types
- Creating clear and informative visualizations
- Customizing plots for better communication
- Using color effectively in data visualization
- Combining multiple visualizations for comprehensive analysis
- Identifying patterns and relationships through visualization
- Handling overplotting and large datasets
- Creating publication-quality figures
- Telling stories with data through visualization
- Best practices for data visualization

These visualization skills are essential for any data scientist, as they enable effective communication of insights and findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. Mastering these techniques allows for more impactful data storytelling and better decision-making based on data.

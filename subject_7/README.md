## Inventory Analysis

**Directory:** `7_1_pandas-inventory-proj`

This project introduces the basics of pandas:
- Loading data from CSV files with `pd.read_csv()`
- Inspecting DataFrames with `head()`
- Selecting columns and rows from DataFrames
- Filtering data with boolean conditions
- Adding new calculated columns
- Using lambda functions with `apply()`
- Performing calculations on DataFrame columns
- String formatting and concatenation

## A/B Testing

**Directory:** `7_2_pandas-shoefly-ab-test`

This project applies pandas to A/B testing analysis:
- Loading and exploring advertising click data
- Filtering and grouping data
- Calculating conversion rates
- Comparing performance across different conditions
- Creating pivot tables
- Analyzing user behavior patterns
- Drawing conclusions from data analysis
- Visualizing results with basic plotting

## Multi-Table Analysis

**Directory:** `7_3_multi-tables-proj`

This project focuses on working with multiple related tables:
- Joining and merging DataFrames
- Understanding different types of joins (inner, outer, left, right)
- Handling missing data after joins
- Calculating funnel metrics and conversion rates
- Analyzing user journeys through multiple steps
- Identifying bottlenecks in conversion processes
- Working with time-series data
- Creating summary statistics from multiple tables

## Jeopardy Data Analysis

**Directory:** `7_4_this-is-jeopardy`

This advanced project demonstrates complex data manipulation:
- Working with large datasets
- Cleaning and preprocessing messy data
- Creating custom filter functions
- String manipulation and case-insensitive searching
- Data type conversion and handling missing values
- Datetime manipulation and filtering by date ranges
- Grouping and aggregation with `groupby()`
- Statistical analysis (mean, counts, etc.)
- Building interactive applications (quiz system)
- Exploring trends and patterns in the data

## Key Data Science Concepts

Throughout these files, several key data science concepts are introduced:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (creating new columns)
- Filtering and subsetting data
- Aggregation and summarization
- Joining and merging datasets
- Time series analysis
- Statistical calculations
- Building data pipelines
- Drawing insights from data

These pandas skills are essential for any data scientist or analyst, providing the foundation for more advanced data science topics like machine learning and deep learning.

## Census Variables

**Directory:** `8_1_variables-of-the-census`

This project focuses on data types and preprocessing:
- Loading data from CSV files
- Checking data types and unique values
- Handling missing values with replacement
- Converting data types (string to int)
- Creating categorical variables with ordered categories
- Label encoding categorical variables
- One-hot encoding categorical variables
- Creating age groups using `pd.cut()`
- Calculating basic statistics (mean, median)

## Data Cleaning

**Directory:** `8_2_data-cleaning-project`

This project demonstrates comprehensive data cleaning techniques:
- Identifying and handling missing values
- Detecting and removing duplicates
- Standardizing formats (dates, text, etc.)
- Handling outliers
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Feature engineering from existing data
- Normalization and standardization
- Imputation strategies for missing data
- Data type conversion and optimization
- Preparing clean datasets for analysis

## Student Data EDA

**Directory:** `8_3_eda-students-project`

This project applies exploratory data analysis to student data:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range)
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis between variables
- Identifying patterns and relationships
- Data visualization for insights
- Hypothesis generation
- Segmentation and grouping
- Trend identification
- Anomaly detection
- Drawing conclusions from data exploration

## NBA Trends Analysis

**Directory:** `8_4_nba-trends`

This advanced project combines statistical analysis with visualization:
- Data filtering and subsetting
- Calculating descriptive statistics
- Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots)
- Creating contingency tables with `crosstab()`
- Calculating proportions
- Statistical testing (Chi-Square test)
- Calculating covariance and correlation
- Analyzing relationships between variables
- Time series analysis of sports performance
- Comparative analysis between teams and seasons

## Key Data Science Concepts

Throughout these files, several key data science concepts are introduced:
- Data quality assessment
- Data preprocessing workflows
- Exploratory data analysis methodology
- Statistical analysis techniques
- Data visualization best practices
- Feature engineering approaches
- Handling categorical and numerical data
- Correlation and causation
- Hypothesis testing
- Drawing actionable insights from data

These data cleaning and EDA skills are crucial for any data scientist, as they form the foundation for more advanced modeling and machine learning tasks. Clean, well-understood data is essential for building reliable and accurate models.

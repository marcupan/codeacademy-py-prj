- Regular expressions for data cleaning
- Converting data types after cleaning
- Splitting columns into multiple columns
- Handling missing values with imputation strategies
- Detecting and removing duplicates
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Visualizing data before and after cleaning
- Working with percentage data
- Creating histograms for distribution analysis
- Exploring relationships between variables
- Handling demographic data with specific formats
- Applying data cleaning pipelines to real-world census data

## Key Data Science Concepts

Throughout these files, several key data science concepts are introduced:
- Advanced data cleaning workflows
- Handling complex, multi-file datasets
- Dealing with inconsistent data formats
- Strategies for missing data imputation
- Data type conversion challenges
- String manipulation for data extraction
- Data validation techniques
- Combining cleaning with exploratory analysis
- Visualizing data quality issues
- Creating reproducible data cleaning pipelines
- Preparing data for advanced analysis

These advanced data cleaning skills are crucial for any data scientist working with real-world datasets, which are rarely clean and often require significant preprocessing before analysis. Mastering these techniques ensures that subsequent analyses and models are built on reliable, high-quality data.

## Applications

The skills demonstrated in this subject have numerous practical applications:
- Census and demographic data analysis
- Public health data preprocessing
- Financial data cleaning
- Survey data preparation
- Customer database maintenance
- Research data management
- Open data integration
- Legacy data system migration
- Data quality assessment and reporting
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes

By applying these advanced techniques, data scientists can transform messy, inconsistent data into structured, reliable datasets ready for analysis and modeling.
